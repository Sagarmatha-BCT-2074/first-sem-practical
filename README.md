# C-programming - practical worksheet programs
## first semester - Batch -2074-BCT
***Especially for Sagarmatha Engineering college***

This repo contains C programs that need to be run on practical classes . These are the codes present in the sheets given during practical or the codes you have to write.

- Each sheets have corresponding `SHEET-N ` folder.
- The Questions given in sheet are named as `Q-N.C`
- The answers to *Write a program* are named as `Q-N-A.C`.
> The programs written are solely compatible in `Turbo C++`,*an old stupid program for today's world.* Hence program contains weird things like:

```C
    #include <conio.h>
    void main(){ 
        clrscr(); // what ??
        getch(); // To terminate the running program ??? LoL
    }

```

- Hence avoid using editors like `code::blocks,geany` which use compilers like `gcc,mingw`

*note* :

- `N` represents number.
- `BCT` represents Bachelors in computer engineering (group).
